# Historical Contingency in Microbial Resilience to Hydrologic Perturbations

A repository for the paper entitled ``Historical Contingency in Microbial Resilience to Hydrologic Perturbations`` currently in review. We designed a mathematical model of a  microbial consortia of two member species competitively growing in a continuous-flow well-mixed reactor to examine the impact of hydrological perturbations on the composition and functions of the microbial community in the context of historical contingencies.

## System requirements
Matlab R2015b+ in Windows  

## Run the Matlab code
Open 'runHistory.m' and choose a task to perform among the followings:

To run the demo in the publication, select `samples` as either `"south"` or `"north"`. 
1. x_vs_D; % To generate Fig. 2 (steady state relationship between the dependent variables and the dilution rate)
2. resilience; % To generate Fig. 4 (Fig. 3 can also be generated by properly adjusting the parameters as described in the paper)
3. hysteresis; % To generate Fig. 5
